React-ToDo

This a a simple ToDo-List built with ReactJS. NodeJS, Express and Mongo

This simple app can be built from scratch just follow the guidelines here and I also to commented the code really well.

Set-up:
Requirements:
NodeJS: To install node in either Windows/Linux please follow these steps: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
MongoDB: To install mongo in either Windows/Linux please follow these steps: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav

Once Node is installed check to see if it's in your computer by running these commands:
  node -v

Windows Users: If this command is not found by your terminal two things:
    1. Restart the terminal and try again
    2. If step 1 does not work. Then you have to add node to your path, follow these steps: http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/how-can-i-add-new-folder-my-system-path
    3. Restart Terminal and try again.

After node is installed and working we install the following dependencies in the project directory:
      1. Express:
       $ npm install --save express
      2. Gulp and Gulp Babel:
       $ npm install gulp-cli -g
       $ npm install gulp --save   
       $ npm install --save gulp-babel babel-preset-es2015
